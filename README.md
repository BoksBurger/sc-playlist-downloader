##Download Playlists from SoundCloud

This is one of my first NodeJS (pet) projects I created back in 2018. 

I needed to automate the tedious task of downloading individual songs from SoundCloud.

The solution is not perfect, but does a good job of downloading songs and maintaining a .m3u playlist file of all the downloaded songs.
